BAYERN and Madrid are the greatest club of all time (I'm a Bayern fan 😎)
Psg No history? 🤫
Madrid did not join. They have always been there
Ten Hag's Ajax 😍
Can't believe psg is in the list
What is Spartak doing there 😂😂😂
"select group" and it's Madrid and Bayern over and over again
Bayern dominant
Madrid and Bayern have done it 3 times 😮🔥
Guardiola used 11 subs… ancelotti doesnt even know who is on his bench.
Madrid was already there, City joined
« PSG have no history » 🤡

Wym Madrid joined… they were already there :) city joined, Madrid came back
It was way less likely to happen back in the days
Idk if it’s good thing or bad thing because it looks like none of those teams won CL after 💯 group stage record

Man city should meet real madrid knock out 😂😂 and the’ll back to league
